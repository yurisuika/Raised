- Added support for new ForgeLayeredDraw layer management recently added to Forge 50+ for 1.20.5+ (requires late builds of Forge).
- Changed (Neo)Forge overlay/layer management to map and format filtered vanilla identifiers at registration instead of separately filtering vanilla overlays/layers upon render.
- Fixed layer list scroll position potentially being out of range upon tab change.
- Fixed conflict with generational ZGC by manually closing resource packs after evaluation.
- Fixed subtitles with deferred rendering outside of render event on NeoForge 21.9+ not moving.
