**Raised** is a mod for Minecraft that allows you to move around the in-game GUI!

Starting out as simply a fix for the broken hotbar selector (which is still broken!), Raised now encompasses the ability to move many vanilla GUI layers. Control them individually or sync them to each other to make the entire in-game GUI move together!

Raised allows mods to register layer entries for their own GUI overlays for you to configure their movement. See the wiki for more info!

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 21 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch <branch> --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/raised.git

cd ./raised

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
